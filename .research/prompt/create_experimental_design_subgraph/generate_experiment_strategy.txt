Input:
You are a cutting-edge AI researcher. Based on the new research method described in # New Methods, please design an overall experimental strategy that will be applied across all experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.

# Instructions
- Define a comprehensive experimental strategy that will guide multiple experiments.
- This strategy should be common to all experiments that will be conducted.
- The strategy should address:
    - What aspects of the proposed method need to be validated (e.g., performance improvement, efficiency, robustness, generalization)
    - What types of comparisons are necessary (e.g., baselines, ablations, state-of-the-art methods)
    - What experimental angles will be used to validate the claims (e.g., quantitative performance, qualitative analysis, computational cost)
    - How to demonstrate the method's effectiveness from multiple perspectives
    - What validation criteria will determine success
- The strategy should be realistic and take into account the experimental environment.
- Focus on the overall approach rather than specific experiment details (which will be defined in subsequent steps).

    "Open Problems": "1. Existing forward-only TTA (NGFAT) still updates only BN γ,β and therefore cannot adapt models that use Group/Layer/Instance Norm or no normalisation at all (e.g. transformers, self-normalising nets).\n2. Forward-only natural-gradient steps are always executed although many test batches are easy – unnecessary parameter noise slows convergence and may accumulate drift in recurring scenarios.\n3. There is no mechanism to detect harmful updates on-device; collapsing on rare, high-entropy inputs remains possible and cannot be rolled back without labelled data.\n4. Current Fisher blocks ignore cross-sample curvature; mini-batches <8 (typical on MCU) give noisy statistics.",
    "Methods": "Method name: ZORRO – Zero-backward Online Risk-aware RObust adaptation.\nKey novelties:\na) Universal forward-Fisher: derive closed-form 2×2 (or 1×1) natural-gradient for *any* affine layer that is a linear map followed by element-wise normalisation f(x)=α(x−μ)/σ+β. This covers BN, GN, LN, IN and the RMS norm of ViT. Statistics (μ,σ) are read from the same forward pass; memory overhead 2×feature-dim.\n\nb) Cross-batch shrinkage: maintain a running Fisher F̂_t and apply James–Stein shrinkage with factor τ_t= n/(n+λ) where n is effective sample count; this drastically reduces noise for tiny batches (n≤4) without extra FLOPs.\n\nc) Accuracy-estimation gate: integrate AETTA-mini (dropout-free variant using Monte-Carlo weight masking) to obtain a label-free error estimate ĥ_t after each batch. Update is *committed* only if ĥ_t − ĥ_{t−1}>ϵ or entropy drop >δ; otherwise parameters are left unchanged (pure inference). This halves update frequency on slow streams and prevents drift.\n\nd) Rollback buffer: store last K=3 accepted parameter states + their ĥ. If two consecutive batches yield worse ĥ than all K checkpoints, revert to best state (cost O(K·P) copy, P tiny because we save only γ,β,α). Fully unsupervised.\n\ne) µC-friendly maths: all matrix inverses are 2×2; no sqrt/exp outside LUT; fits in CMSIS-NN.\n",
    "Experimental Setup": "Datasets & streams:\n• TinyImageNet-C (severity 3-5) with η_r∈{1,1/2,1/8}.\n• CIFAR-10-C and CIFAR-10.1 natural shift.\n• Google Speech Commands v2 with background noise (audio, shows non-vision generality).\n• Real on-device capture: 5-fps webcam stream on STM32H7 (640 KB SRAM).\n\nModels: ResNet-20-GN, MobileNet-V2-GN, ViT-Tiny with RMS Norm, and a 1-D CNN for speech.\n\nBaselines: Source, TENT, FATENT, NGFAT, RoTTA, AETTA-reset, BN adaptive.\n\nMetrics:\n1. Error after {1,2,4} batches.\n2. Area-under-error-curve under Realistic Online Protocol (ROP, η_r).\n3. Avg. wall-clock latency & energy (Arm-Cortex-M vs Jetson-Nano).\n4. False-update rate (updates skipped although target batch lowered error <0.1 %).\n5. Collapse-recovery success (% runs where rollback prevents >5 % error spike).\n",
    "Experimental Code": "# zorro.py  (core update-gate, 60 LOC)\n@torch.no_grad()\ndef zorro_step(model, batch, state):\n    out = model(batch)\n    H = entropy(out)\n    ## 1. Unsup. accuracy proxy via softmax disagreement\n    q = out.softmax(1)\n    p = (q * (1-q)).sum(1)             # variance proxy\n    acc_hat = 1 - p.mean()\n    ## 2. Decide whether to adapt\n    if (acc_hat < state.last_acc-1e-3) or (H.mean()>state.last_H*0.9):\n        for mod in state.affine:       # BN, GN, LN, RMSNorm\n            y = mod.output             # cached activation\n            g = state.dH_dz @ y.mean(0)  # ∂H/∂α like NGFAT\n            F = y.var(0)+1e-5\n            tau = state.n/(state.n+state.lambda_)\n            step = -tau * g / F\n            mod.weight += step\n        state.save_checkpoint(acc_hat)\n    state.update_stats(acc_hat, H)\n    return out",
    "Expected Result": "• Matches NGFAT accuracy on CIFAR-C but with 35 % fewer parameter updates.\n• On GN/LN models where BN-only methods fail, ZORRO reduces error from 38 % (source) to 24 % within 2 batches, beating TENT-GN (27 %).\n• MCU demo: 5 fps stream maintained at 3.7 mJ/frame vs 6.2 mJ for TENT.\n• Rollback prevents >90 % of catastrophic error spikes observed in NGFAT under recurring shift.\n• Audio CNN: word error 8.1 %→6.4 % after first noisy batch, showing modality-agnosticism.",
    "Expected Conclusion": "ZORRO generalises forward-only natural-gradient TTA to any normalisation layer, autonomously decides *when* to adapt via built-in label-free risk estimates, and adds a lightweight rollback against collapse. It retains single-pass speed, extends applicability to transformers and micro-controllers, and raises the bar for robust, energy-aware test-time learning in real-world streams."

    "experiment_strategy": "Overall experimental strategy for demonstrating the effectiveness of ZORRO\n\n1. Core validation axes\n   a. Adaptation benefit – Does ZORRO lower on-line error faster and further than all competitors?\n   b. Efficiency – Does it achieve that benefit with fewer parameter updates, lower latency, and lower energy?\n   c. Robustness – Does it remain stable under severe or recurring shifts and avoid catastrophic drift?\n   d. Generality – Does it work across normalisation types, model families, modalities, batch sizes, and hardware classes?\n   e. Safety – Can the gate + rollback reject harmful updates better than prior art?\n\n2. Comparative framework\n   • Methods: (i) frozen source model, (ii) classic BN adaptation, (iii) forward-only SOTA (TENT, NGFAT, FATENT), (iv) risk-aware SOTA (RoTTA, AETTA-reset), (v) ZORRO ablations (−Fisher, −shrinkage, −gate, −rollback, −all) and full ZORRO.\n   • Datasets/shifts: vision, audio, synthetic recurrences, real device streams. Each experiment will use an identical set of comparison methods so curves are directly overlayable.\n   • Hardware profiles: A100 (heavy), Jetson-Nano (edge GPU), STM32H7 (MCU) – same software harness, differing batch-size budgets.\n\n3. Multi-angle evidence collection\n   • Quantitative accuracy: instantaneous error at fixed adaptation horizons {1,2,4,∞} batches; area-under-error-curve (AUEC) over the whole stream; Wilcoxon signed-rank test over 5 seeds.\n   • Adaptation cost: (i) number of parameter update steps, (ii) wall-clock latency per frame, (iii) mean energy per frame (on-board power logger for Jetson / MCU).\n   • Stability metrics: variance of error, maximum error spike, collapse rate, rollback recovery rate, false-update rate.\n   • Qualitative analysis: histogram of gate decisions, t-SNE of feature drift, visual audio/vision examples where ZORRO reverted.\n   • Computational analysis: FLOPs, memory, additional parameters; measured with Torch-Profiler and MCU on-device counters.\n\n4. Experimental phases (common skeleton for every task)\n   Phase-0: Baseline replication to calibrate code, fix seeds, and verify that results reproduce published numbers on clean data.\n   Phase-1: Standard corruptions – run single-pass streams under ROP; log all core metrics.\n   Phase-2: Recurring/easy-hard cycles – stress test the gate/rollback; identical shift schedule for all methods.\n   Phase-3: Tiny-batch regime – constrain batch ≤4 to expose Fisher shrinkage; repeat Phase-1 metrics.\n   Phase-4: Hardware deployment – run frozen inference & on-line adaptation in real-time on Jetson/MCU; capture energy & fps.\n   Phase-5: Ablation sweep – repeat Phases 1–3 with each component disabled to pinpoint contribution.\n   Phase-6: Cross-modality – apply to Speech Commands; same phases 1–3.\n\n5. Success criteria (must hold in ≥4/5 seeds)\n   • AUEC improvement ≥10% over best non-ZORRO competitor on every dataset-model pair.\n   • Parameter-update count ≤70% of NGFAT average while maintaining equal or better final error.\n   • Catastrophic collapse rate <1%; rollback recovers ≥80% of induced collapses.\n   • Latency overhead ≤5% vs source inference on A100; energy per frame ≤65% of TENT on MCU.\n   • No ablation variant may outperform full ZORRO on more than 10% of runs.\n\n6. Statistical protocol\n   • 5 random seeds × 5 shuffled test streams per condition.\n   • Report median and 95% CI; conduct paired Wilcoxon tests with Holm-Bonferroni correction.\n   • Release code, logs, and weights for full transparency.\n\n7. Resource allocation\n   • Distributed runner uses 6 A100 GPUs for parallel seeds, leaving 2 GPUs for hyper-parameter sweeps.\n   • RAM headroom (2 TB) holds all datasets and checkpoints in a RAM-disk, eliminating I/O variance.\n   • Edge hardware tests run nightly; results auto-synced to central dashboard.\n\nThis unified strategy ensures every experiment, regardless of dataset or model, produces directly comparable evidence on adaptation benefit, cost, robustness, generality, and safety, thereby establishing a comprehensive case for ZORRO’s effectiveness."
