Improved Test-Time Adaptation for Domain Generalization Liang Chen1 Yong Zhang2* Yibing Song3 Ying Shan2 Lingqiao Liu1∗ 1 The University of Adelaide 2 Tencent AI Lab 3 AI3 Institute, Fudan University {liangchen527, zhangyong201303, yibingsong.cv}@gmail.com yingsshan@tencent.com lingqiao.liu@adelaide.edu.au Abstract The main challenge in domain generalization (DG) is to handle the distribution shift problem that lies between the training and test data. Recent studies suggest that test-time training (TTT), which adapts the learned model with test data, might be a promising solution to the problem. Gen- erally, a TTT strategy hinges its performance on two main factors: selecting an appropriate auxiliary TTT task for up- dating and identifying reliable parameters to update during the test phase. Both previous arts and our experiments in- dicate that TTT may not improve but be detrimental to the learned model if those two factors are not properly consid- ered. This work addresses those two factors by proposing an Improved Test-Time Adaptation (ITTA) method. First, in- stead of heuristically defining an auxiliary objective, we pro- pose a learnable consistency loss for the TTT task, which con- tains learnable parameters that can be adjusted toward bet- ter alignment between our TTT task and the main prediction task. Second, we introduce additional adaptive parameters for the trained model, and we suggest only updating the adap- tive parameters during the test phase. Through extensive ex- periments, we show that the proposed two strategies are ben- eficial for the learned model (see Figure 1), and ITTA could achieve superior performance to the current state-of-the-art methods on several DG benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/liangchen527/ITTA. 1. Introduction Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of deep learning models, which often assume the training and test data are from the same domain and follow the same distribution. However, this assumption does not always hold in real-world scenarios. Distribution shift among the source and target domains is ubiquitous in related areas [35], such as autonomous driving or object recognition tasks, resulting *Corresponding authors.

Performance improvements from the proposed two strate- gies (i.e. introducing a learnable consistency loss and including additional adaptive parameters to improve TTT) for the baseline model (i.e. ResNet18 [30] with existing augmentation strategy [75]). Experiments are conducted on the PACS dataset [37] with the leave- one-out setting. Following [27], we use 60 sets of random seeds and hyper-parameters for each target domain. The reported average accuracy and error bars verify the effectiveness of our method. in poor performances for delicately designed models and hindering the further application of deep learning techniques. Domain generalization (DG) [2,8,16,23,24,31,38 –40,40, 44, 47, 51, 52, 69], designed to generalize a learned model to unseen target domains, has attracted a great deal of attention in the research community. The problem can be traced back to a decade ago [7], and various approaches have been pro- posed to push the DG boundary ever since. Those efforts in- clude invariant representation learning [28,47,49,58], adver- sarial learning [23,40,44,69], augmentation [9,41,42,66,75], or meta-learning [2, 16, 38, 39]. Despite successes on certain occasions, a recent study [27] shows that, under a rigorous evaluation protocol, most of these arts are inferior to the baseline empirical risk minimization (ERM) method [61]. This finding is not surprising, as most current arts strive to decrease the distribution shift only through the training data while overlooking the contributions from test samples. Recently, the test-time training (TTT) technique [60] has been gaining momentum for easing the distribution shift problem. TTT lies its success in enabling dynamic tuning of the pretrained model with the test samples via an auxil- iary TTT task, which seems to be a promising effort when arXiv:2304.04494v2  [cs.CV]  16 Apr 2023confronting data from different domains. However, TTT is not guaranteed to improve the performance. Previous arts [46, 63] indicate that selecting an appropriate auxiliary TTT task is crucial, and an inappropriate one that does not align with the main loss may deteriorate instead of improv- ing the performance. Meanwhile, it is pointed out in [63] that identifying reliable parameters to update is also essential for generalization, which is in line with our experimental findings in Sec. 5.3. Both of these two tasks are non-trivial, and there are limited efforts made to address them. This paper aims to improve the TTT strategy for better DG. First, different from previous works that empirically define auxiliary objectives and assume they are aligned with the main task, our work does not make such assumptions. Instead, we suggest learning an appropriate auxiliary loss for test-time updating. Specifically, encouraged by recent successes in multi-view consistency learning [13,26,29], we propose to augment the consistency loss by adding learn- able parameters based on the original implementation, where the parameters can be adjusted to assure our TTT task can be more aligned with the main task and are updated by en- forcing the two tasks share the same optimization direction. Second, considering that identifying reliable parameters to update is an everlasting job given the growing size of current deep models, we suggest introducing new adaptive param- eters after each block during the test phase, and we only tune the new parameters by the learned consistency loss while leaving the original parameters unchanged. Through extensive evaluations on the current benchmark [27], we illustrate that the learnable consistency loss performs more effectively than the self-supervised TTT tasks adopted in previous arts [60, 63], and by tuning only the new adaptive parameters, our method is superior to existing strategies that update all the parameters or part of them. This work aims to ease the distribution shift problem by improving TTT, and the main contributions are three-fold: • We introduce a learnable consistency loss for test-time adaptation, which can be enforced to be more aligned with the main loss by tuning its learnable parameters. • We introduce new adaptive parameters for the trained model and only update them during the test phase. • We conduct experiments on various DG benchmarks and illustrate that our ITTA performs competitively against current arts under the rigorous setting [27] for both the multi-source and single-source DG tasks. 2. Related Works 2.1. Domain Generalization. Being able to generalize to new environments while de- ploying is a challenging and practical requirement for cur- rent deep models. Existing DG approaches can be roughly categorized into three types. (1) Invariant representation learning: The pioneering work [5] theoretically proves that if the features remain invariant across different domains, then they are general and transferable to different domains. Guided by this finding, [47] uses maximum mean discrep- ancy (MMD) to align the learned features, and [25] proposes to use a multi-domain reconstruction auto-encoder to obtain invariant features. More recently, [58] suggests maximiz- ing the inner product of gradients from different domains to enforce invariance, and a similar idea is proposed in [52] where these gradients are expected to be similar to their mean values. (2) Optimization algorithms: Among the different optimization techniques adopted in DG, prevail- ing approaches resort to adversarial learning [23, 40, 44, 69] and meta-learning [2, 16, 38, 39]. Adversarial training is often used to enforce the learned features to be agnostic about the domain information. In [23], a domain-adversarial neural network (DANN) is implemented by asking the main- stream feature to maximize the domain classification loss. This idea is also adopted in [44], where adversarial training and an MMD constraint are employed to update an auto- encoder. Meanwhile, the meta-learning technique is used to simulate the distribution shifts between seen and unseen environments [2, 16, 38, 39], and most of these works are developed based on the MAML framework [20]. (3) Aug- mentation: Most augmentation skills applied in the general- ization tasks are operated in the feature level [34, 41, 48, 75] except for [11,66,68] which mix images [68] or its phase [66] to synthesize new data. To enable contrastive learning, we incorporate an existing augmentation strategy [75] in our framework. This method originated from AdaIN [32], which synthesizes new domain information by mixing the statistics of the features. Similar ideas can be found in [42, 48]. 2.2. Test-Time Training and Adaptation Test-Time Training (TTT) is first introduced in [60]. The basic paradigm is to employ a test-time task besides the main task during the training phase and update the pre- trained model using the test data with only the test-time objective before the final prediction step. The idea is empir- ically proved effective [60] and further developed in other related areas [3, 10, 12, 14, 21, 22, 43, 56, 63, 65, 73, 74]. Most current works focus on finding auxiliary tasks for updat- ing during the test phase, and the efforts derive from self- supervion [3, 10, 21, 22, 43, 60], meta-learning [65, 73, 74], information entropy [63], pseudo-labeling [12, 14], to name a few. However, not all empirically selected test-time tasks are effective. A recent study [46] indicates that only when the auxiliary loss aligns with the main loss can TTT improve the trained model. Inspired by that, we propose a learnable consistency loss and enforce alignment between the two ob- jectives. Results show that our strategy can be beneficial for the trained model (see Figure 1).subtract Figure 2. Training process of ITTA. We use x from the source domain as input for the feature extractor fθ(·) to obtain the repre- sentation z and its augmented version z′, where the augmentation skill from [75] is applied. The classifier fϕ(·) and weight subnet- work fw(·) are used to compute the main loss Lmain and learnable consistency loss Lwcont. Please refer to our text for details. Meanwhile, [63] suggests that auxiliary loss is not the only factor that affects the performance. Selecting reliable parameters to update is also crucial within the TTT frame- work. Given the large size of current models, correctly iden- tifying these parameters may require tremendous amounts of effort. To this end, instead of heuristically selecting candi- dates, we propose to include new adaptive parameters for up- dating during the test phase. Experimental results show that the proposed method can obtain comparable performances against existing skills. 3. Methodology In the task of DG, we are often given access to data from S (S ≥ 1) source domains Ds = {D1, D2, ..., DS} and expect a model to make good prediction on unseen target domains Dt = {D1, D2, ..., DT } (T ≥ 1). Our method aims to improve the test-time training (TTT) strategy for better DG. The improvements are two-fold. First, we pro- pose a learnable consistency loss for the TTT task, which could be enforced to align with the main objective by tuning its learnable weights. Second, we suggest including addi- tional adaptive parameters and only updating these adaptive parameters during the test phase. 3.1. A Learnable Consistency Loss for TTT The TTT strategies have shown promising performances when dealing with distribution shift problems [43, 63]. How- ever, their successes are depended on the empirically selected auxiliary TTT tasks, which may deteriorate the performances if chosen improperly. Motivated by the recent successes in multi-view consistency learning [13, 26, 29], we suggest adopting a consistency loss in our TTT task. Note that the naive consistency loss is still not guaranteed to be effective as prior art [46] indicates that only when the auxiliary loss aligns with the main loss, can TTT improves the perfor- mance. To this end, we propose to augment the auxiliary loss with learnable parameters that could be adjusted toward a better alignment between the TTT and main tasks. In our case, we make the adopted consistency loss learnable by introducing a weight subnetwork that allows flexible ways Algorithm 1 Pseudo code of the training phase of ITTA in a PyTorch-like style. # fθ, fϕ, fw: feature extractor, classifier, weight subnetwork # α, 0: weight paramter, all zero tensor # training process for x, yin training loader: # load a minibatch with N samples def forward process(x, y): z, z′ = fθ.forward(x) # computing losses Lmain = CrossEntropyLoss(fϕ.forward(z), y) Lmain+ =CrossEntropyLoss(fϕ.forward(z′), y) Lwcont = MSELoss(fw.forward(z − z′), 0) return Lmain, Lwcont # SGD update: feature extractor and classifier Lmain, Lwcont = forward process(x, y) ([fθ.params, fϕ.params]).zero grad() (Lmain + αLwcont).backward() update(  fθ.params, fϕ.params  ) # compute objectives for updating weight subnetwork Lmain, Lwcont = forward process(x, y) Lmain.backward() ˆgmain = fθ.params.grad.clone().normalize() fθ.params.zero grad() Lwcont.backward() ˆgwcont = fθ.params.grad.clone().normalize() # SGD update: weight subnetwork MSELoss(ˆgmain, ˆgwcont).backward() fw.params.zero grad() update(fw.params) to measure the consistency between two views of the same instance. We first introduce the pipeline of our training framework. Given the D dimensional representation z ∈ RD1 and its corresponding augmented version z′ that are obtained from a feature extractor (i.e. {z, z′} = fθ(x), where x is an input image from Ds, and fθ(·) is the feature extractor parame- terized by θ. In our implementation, we use the existing augmentation method [75] to obtain z′ by modifying the intermediate activation in fθ(x). We show in our supplemen- tary material that our framework can also thrive with other augmentation strategies), our learnable consistency loss is given by, Lwcont = ∥fw(z − z′)∥, (1) where ∥ · ∥denotes the L2 norm; fw(·) is the weight sub- network parameterized by w. To make the training process more stable and potentially achieve better performance, we apply a dimension-wise nonlinear function to map each di- mension of z − z′ before calculating the L2 norm. That is, ∀h ∈ RD, fw(h) is implemented by stacking layers of a nonlinear function: ReLU(a ∗ h + b), where a ∈ RD and b ∈ RD are the weight and bias from the nonlinear function, 1We omit the batch dimensions of the variables for simplicity.… … subtract Figure 3. Test adaptation process of ITTA. Different from that in the training stage, we include additional adaptive parameters fΘ after each block of the feature extractor fθ. For each test sample x, the intermediate representations zi and z′i obtained from fi θ are passed to fi Θ before going to the next block fi+1 θ . We use the learnable consistency loss Lwcont as the objective to update fΘ. Please refer to our text for details. and different layers of a, bform the parameter w in fw. In effect, this creates a piecewise-linear mapping function for h: depending on the value of h, the output could be 0, a constant, or a scaling-and-shifted version of h. More studies about the design of fw are provided in our supplementary material. Compared to the naive consistency learning with- out fw, our Lwcont can be more flexible with an adjustable fw, which we show in the following is the key for learning an appropriate loss in the improved TTT framework. Combining Lwcont with the main loss Lmain which applies the cross-entropy loss (CE) for both the origi- nal and augmented inputs ( i.e. Lmain = CE(fϕ(z), y) + CE(fϕ(z′), y), where fϕ is the classifier parameterized by ϕ, and y is the corresponding label), the objective for the feature extractor and classifier can be formulated into, min{θ,ϕ} Lmain + αLwcont, (2) where α is the weight parameter that balances the contri- butions from the two terms. A simple illustration of the workflow is shown in Figure 2. From Eq. (2), the expected gradients for the feature ex- tractor from Lmain and Lwcont can be represented as,  gmain = ∇θ(CE(fϕ(z), y) + CE(fϕ(z′), y)), (3) gwcont = ∇θ∥fw(z − z′)∥. (4) We observe that the direction of gwcont is also determined by the weight subnetwork fw(·), which should be close with gmain to ensure alignment between Lmain and Lwcont [46, 60]. To this end, we propose a straightforward solution by enforcing equality between the normalized versions of gmain and gwcont, and we use this term as the objective for updating fw(·), which gives, min w Lalign, s.t. Lalign = ∥ˆgmain − ˆgwcont∥, (5) where ˆgmain = gmain−Egmain σgmain , and similar for ˆgwcont. In our implementation, we update {θ, ϕ} and w in an alternative manner. Pseudo code of the training process are shown in Algorithm 1.

Including Additional Adaptive Parameters Selecting expressive and reliable parameters to update during the test phase is also essential in the TTT frame- work [63]. Some strategies decide to update all the parame- ters from the feature extractor [3, 43], while others use only the parameters from the specific layers for updating [63, 71]. Given the fact that the sizes of current deep models are often very large and still growing, exhaustively trying different combinations among the millions of candidates seems to be an everlasting job. As there are no consensuses on which parameter should be updated, we suggest another easy alter- native in this work. Specifically, assuming there are a total of m blocks in the pretrained feature extractor fθ(·), and the i-th block can be denoted as fi θ(·). Then the intermediate representation zi from fi θ(·) can be formulated as, zi = fi θ(zi−1), s.t. z1 = f1 θ (x). (6) We propose to include additional adaptive blockfΘ that is parameterized by Θ after each block of fθ during the test- time adaptation phase, which reformulates Eq. (6) into, zi = fi Θ(fi θ(zi−1)), s.t. z1 = f1 Θ(f1 θ (x)), (7) where fΘ(·) does not change the dimension and sizes of the intermediate representations. In our work, we use a structure similar to fw to implement fΘ. Note zm is simplified as z in this phase, and the same process is applied for obtaining z′. Then, in the test-time adaptation phase, we suggest only updating the new adaptive parameters via the learned con- sistency loss. The optimization process can be written as,Table 1.

(8) Note that different from the training phase, x in this stage is from the target domain Dt, and we use the online setting in [60] for updating. A simple illustration of the test adaptation pipeline is shown in Figure 3. For the final step, we use the original representation ob- tained from the pretrained feature extractor and the adapted adaptive parameters for prediction. Pseudo code of the test stage are shown in Algorithm 2. 4. Experiments 4.1. Settings Datasets. We evalute ITTA on five benchmark datasets: PACS [37] which consists of 9,991 images from 7 cate- gories. This dataset is probably the most widely-used DG benchmark owing to its large distributional shift across 4 do- mains including art painting, cartoon, photo, and sketch; VLCS [18] contains 10,729 images of 5 classes from 4 different datasets (i.e. domains) including PASCAL VOC 2007 [17], LabelMe [54], Caltech [19], and Sun [64] where each dataset is considered a domain in DG;OfficeHome [62] is composed of 15,588 images from 65 classes in office and home environments, and those images can be categorized into 4 domains (i.e. artistic, clipart, product, and real world); TerraInc [4] has 24,788 images from 10 classes. Those images are wild animals taken from 4 different locations (i.e. domains) including L100, L38, L43, and L46; Domain- Net [50] which contains 586,575 images from 345 classes, and the images in it can be depicted in 6 styles (i.e. clipart, infograph, painting, quickdraw, real, and sketch). Implementation details. For all the experiments, we use the ImageNet [15] pretrained ResNet18 [30] backbone that with 4 blocks as the feature extractor fθ, which could en- large the gaps in DG compared to larger models [70]. Corre- spondingly, we also include 4 blocks of additional adaptive parameters (i.e. fΘ), and each block is implemented with 5 layers of learnable parameters with weight initialized as all ones and bias initialized as all zeros. For the weight subnet- work fw, we use 10 layers of learnable parameters with the initialization skill similar to that of fΘ. The classifier fϕ is an MLP layer provided by the Domainbed benchmark [27]. For the weight parameter α in Eq. (2), we set it to be 1 for all experiments (please refer to our supplementary material for analysis). The random seeds, learning rates, batch size, and augmentation skills are all dynamically set for all the compared arts according to [27].Table 2. Single source domain generalization. Experiments are conducted on the PACS dataset [37]. Here A, C, P, and S are the art, cartoon, photo, and sketch domains in PACS.

For all the compared methods, we conduct 60 trials on each source domain, and each with 5,000 iteration steps. During the training stage, we split the examples from training domains to 8:2 (train:val) where the training and validation samples are dynamically selected among different training trials. During test, we select the model that performs the best in the validation samples and test it on the target domains. The strategy is referred to as the “training-domain validate set” model selec- tion method in [27]. For each domain in different datasets, the final performance is the average accuracy from the 60 trials. 4.2. Multi-Source Generalization In these experiments, all five benchmark datasets afore- mentioned are used for evaluation, and the leave-one-out strategy is adopted for training (i.e. with S = |Ds ∪Dt|2 −1, and T = 1). Results are shown in Table 1. We note that ERM method obtains favorable performance against existing arts. In fact, as a strong baseline, ERM is superior to half of the methods in the term of average accuracy, and only 5 arts (i.e. SelfReg [34], Fish [58], CORAL [59], SD [51], and ours) among the compared 22 methods outperforms ERM in most datasets (i.e. with Score ≥ 3). In comparison, the proposed ITTA is more effective than all other models on average. In particular, ITTA achieves the best performances in 3 out of the 5 benchmarks (i.e. PACS, VLCS, and TerraInc datasets) and 4 in the top 5. Note that although our method does not obtain the best performances in the OfficeHome and DomainNet benchmarks, it still outperforms more than half 2We use | · |to denote the number of domains in the environment. of the existing models. The results validate the effectiveness of our method when tested in the multi-source setting. We present results of average accuracy in each domain from different datasets in the supplementary material. Please refer to it for details. 4.3. Single-Source Generalization In these experiments, we adopt the widely-used PACS [37] benchmark for evaluation, and the models are trained on one domain while tested on the remaining three (i.e. with S = 1, and T = 3). Although some approaches, such as MLDG [38] and Fishr [52], may require more than one domain information for their trainings, we can simu- late multi-domain information using only the source domain, and thus the experimental settings are still feasible for them. Compared to the multi-source generalization task, the single- source generalization is considered more difficult due to the limited domain information during the training phase. Evalu- ation results are presented in Table 2. We note that the ERM method outperforms most state-of-the-art models, and only 5 models, including VREx [36], Fishr [52], SagNet [48], MixStyle [75], and the proposed ITTA, can obtain better re- sults than ERM in the term of average accuracy. Meanwhile, our method achieves the best performances when trained in 5 out of the 12 source domain, and it obtains the best perfor- mance on average, leading more than 2% than the second best (i.e. MixStyle [75]) and 3% the ERM method. In line with the findings in [27], we notice that the naive ERM method [61] can indeed perform favorably against most existing models under rigorous evaluation protocol. As a matter of fact, the proposed method is the only one that consistently outperforms ERM in both the multi-sourceTable 3.

These results indicate that DG remains challenging for current efforts that aim to ease the distribution shift only through training data, and using the proposed improved TTT strategy may be a promising direc- tion for solving DG. 5. Analysis All experiments in this section are conducted on the widely-used PACS benchmark [37] with the leave-one-out strategy. The experimental settings are the same as that illus- trated in Sec. 4.1. Please refer to our supplementary material for more analysis. 5.1. Compared with Other TTT-Based Models Using test-time adaptation to ease the distribution shift problem has been explored in previous works, such as the original TTT method [60] and MT3 [3]. Their differences lie in that TTT uses a rotation estimation task for the test-time objective, and MT3 adopts a contrastive loss for the task and implements the overall framework using MAML [20]. There is also a recently proposed TENT [63] that aims to minimize the entropy of the final results by tuning the parameters from the batch normalization (BN) layers. To analyze the overall effectiveness of our method, we compare ITTA with these arts using the same baseline (i.e. ResNet18 [30] backbone with the existing augmentation skill [75]). Results are shown in Table 3. We observe that all the com- pared TTT-based methods can improve the baseline model in almost all target domains except for the “Photo” domain, which might be due to the ImageNet pretraining [67]. This phenomenon demonstrates that the TTT strategy may be a promising effort for easing the distribution shift problem. Meanwhile, we observe that the proposed ITTA is superior to all other approaches in most target domains and leads in the term of average accuracy. The main reason is that compared to the empirically designed TTT tasks adopted in previous works, the proposed learnable consistency loss is enforced to be more aligned with the main loss, thus more suitable for the test-time adaptation task [46]. Meanwhile, compared to the strategies that update the original param- eters from the trained model, the adaptation of the newly included parameters is also more effective for the overall (a) Input (b) Ours w/o fw (c) Ours (d) Main Figure 4. Grad-CAM [57] visualizations from different loss terms. We use images with varying class labels from the four target do- mains of PACS [37] as inputs (i.e. art, cartoon, photo, and sketch domains from top to bottom). Ours w/o fw is the naive consis- tency loss with fw disabled in Eq. (1). The proposed learnable consistency loss can align well with the main classification task. TTT framework. In the following, we provide more analysis to support these claims. 5.2. Effectiveness of the Learnable Consistency Loss To examine the effectiveness of our learnable consistency loss, we conduct ablation studies by comparing our method with the following variants. (1) Ours w/o fw: we disable fw when computing the learnable consistency loss in Eq. (1), which uses the naive consistency loss for the auxiliary TTT task. (2) Ours w/ Ent.: after training the model using the baseline settings (i.e. ResNet18 with the augmentation strat- egy [75]), we use the entropy minimization task in [63] for the TTT task. (3) Ours w/ Rot.: we use the rotation estimation task in [60] for the TTT task. To ensure fair com- parisons, we use the same baseline settings and include the same additional adaptive parameters for all the variants. Results are shown in the 4th to 6th rows Table 4. We find that the results from the naive consistency loss ( i.e. Ours w/o fw) are slightly better than that from the other two specially-designed objectives (i.e. Ours w/ Ent. and Ours w/ Rot.) on average. Besides the possibility of deteriorating the performance [46], our results indicate that empirically select- ing a TTT task may also be far from optimal. Meanwhile, we observe that when enabling fw, the proposed learnable consistency loss is superior to that withoutfw in all target do-Table 4.

These results are not surprising. By comparing the Grad-CAM [57] visualizations from the main classification task with the learnable and naive consistency losses in Figure 4, we find that the proposed learnable objec- tive can well align with the main loss when fw is enabled as the hot zones activated by these two tasks are similar, which guarantees the improvement for the test-time adapta- tion [46, 60]. Please refer to our supplementary material for more visualizations. 5.3. Effectiveness of the Adaptive Parameters We compare ITTA with three variants to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed additional adaptive parameters. (1) Ours w/o TTT: we do not update any parameters during the test phase. This variant is used to verify whether TTT can improve the pretrained model. (2) Ours w/ ALL: similar to the updating strategy in the original TTT method [60], we update all the parameters from the feature extractor during the test phase. (3) Ours w/ BN: following the suggestion from TENT [63], only parameters from the BN layers of the feature extractor are updated. Note the same pretrained model is shared for all variants in these experiments, and the objectives during the test adaptation phase are to minimize the same learned consistency loss. We list the results in the last three rows in Table 4. We observe that when only updating parameters from the BN layers, the performance is inferior to the strategy without test-time adaptation, and updating all the parameters does not ensure improvements in all target domains. The observations are in line with the findings in [63] that selecting reliable parameters to update is essential in the TTT system and may also interact with the choice of the TTT task. In comparison, when including additional adaptive parameters for updating, the pretrained model can be boosted in all environments. The results validate that our adaptive parameters are more effective than that selected with existing strategies [60, 63] when applied with the proposed learnable test-time objective. 5.4. Limitation Although the proposed learned loss can bring satisfaction improvements, we are aware that the lunch is not free. When the weight subnetwork fw is disabled, updating the joint loss in Eq. (2) only costs 1 forward and 1 backward. However, in order to update fw, we have to compute the second-order derivative in Eq. (5), which will require 1 more forward and 3 more backward processes, bringing extra burden to the system. Our future efforts aim to simplify the overall optimization process and reduce the cost for ITTA. 6. Conclusion In this paper, we aim to improve the current TTT strategy for alleviating the distribution shift problem in DG. First, given that the auxiliary TTT task plays a vital role in the over- all framework, and an empirically selecting one that does not align with the main task may potentially deteriorate instead of improving the performance, we propose a learnable con- sistency loss that can be enforced to be more aligned with the main loss by adjusting its learnable parameters. This strategy is ensured to improve the model and shows favorable perfor- mance against some specially-designed objectives. Second, considering that selecting reliable and effective parameters to update during the test phase is also essential while exhaus- tively trying different combinations may require tremendous effort, we propose a new alternative by including new ad- ditional adaptive parameters for adaptation during the test phase. This alternative is shown to outperform some pre- vious parameter selecting strategies via our experimental findings. By conducting extensive experiments under a rig- orous evaluation protocol, we show that our method can achieve superior performance against existing arts in both the multi-source and single-source DG tasks.

Resource Usage Comparisons Between ITTA and the Baseline Model Requiring extra resources for our ITTA is a common lim- itation for existing test-time-based arts. To further evaluate our method, in this section, we compare FLOPS, model size, and inference time in Table 5. We compare only with ERM as most existing methods utilize the same network during in- ferences. We note that compare to the baseline model, ITTA requires extra Flops and processing time, this is because the adaptation process uses extra forward and backward steps during the test phase. While the parameters between the two models are similar because the newly included adaptive blocks are much smaller in size compared to the original model. Table 5.

Grad-CAM Visualizations of Different Self- Supervised Objectives In Section 5 of the manuscript, we provide Grad-CAM [57] visualizations of our learnable consistency and the main losses to illustrate their alignment. To further show the differences between several TTT tasks [60, 63], we present more visual examples in this section. Results are shown in Figure 5. We observe that the entropy minimization [63] and rotation estimation [60] objectives do not activate the same regions as the main loss. As shown in the first row, for the class label of giraffe, both the main loss and our learned loss can correctly locate the two giraffes in the image, while the rotation estimation task can only locate one target, the same observation can be found when the learned weightsare disabled in our loss term. Meanwhile, although the two objects can be found for the entropy minimization task, the corresponding hot region does not align with that of the main loss. Similar phenomena can be observed in other samples. These visual examples demonstrate that our learned objective can better align with the main task than the TTT tasks adopted in previous works [60, 63], explaining why using the proposed learnable consistency loss can better improve TTT. 9. Parameter Analysis In this section, we analyze the hyper-parameter used in ITTA. We use the weight parameterα to balance the contri- butions from the main loss and weighted consistency loss (i.e. Lmain + αLwcont in Eq. (2) of our manuscript). To analyze the sensitivity of ITTA regarding different values of α, we conduct ablation studies in the PACS benchmark [37]. Results are listed in Table 6. We observe that the proposed ITTA can obtain favorable performances when α is in the range of 0.1 to 10, and it performs the best on average when setting as 1. We thus fix the parameter as 1 in all experi- ments. 10. A Different Augmentation Skill for ITTA In our manuscript, we use the existing augmentation strat- egy from [75] to obtain the augmented feature. In this sec- tion, we replace this implementation with that from [41] to further verify if our ITTA can still thrive with another aug- mentation skill. Different from [75] that mixes the statics of the feature to synthesize new information, [41] uses an affine transformation to create new features, where the weight for the transformation is sampled from a normal distribution with the mean value of one and standard value of zero, and the bias for the transformation is sampled from a normal distribution with the mean and standard values both zero. Experiments are conducted on the PACS benchmark [37] with the leave-one-out strategy. We compare ITTA with several different variants. (1) Ours w/o fw & TTT: this variant is the baseline model which uses the naive consistency loss for training and does not include TTT during the test phase. (2) Ours w/o fw: we disable the fw in our consistency loss, which uses the naive consistency loss for the test-time updating. (3) Ours w/o TTT: we do not update any parameters during the test phase. This variant is used to verify whether TTT can improve the pretrained model when replacing the augmentation strategy. We also compare these variants with the ERM method to show their effectivenesses. Results are listed in Table 7. We observe that ERM per- forms favorably against the baseline model, indicating that this augmentation strategy may not be beneficial for the training process. Meanwhile, we observe that when fw is disabled, the performances seem to decrease in 3 out of 4 target domains, and the average accuracy is also inferior to the baseline (i.e. Ours w/o fw & TTT). This result is in line with the finding in [46] that an inappropriate TTT task may deteriorate the performance. In comparison, we note that the performances are both improved when fw is enabled (i.e. Ours w/o TTT and Ours), which once again demonstrates that the proposed learnable consistency loss can improve the trained model. Moreover, we can also observe that when combining fw and TTT, our model is superior to other vari- ants and the ERM method. These results demonstrate that the proposed two strategies can improve the current TTT framework despite a less effective augmentation strategy. 11. Different Updating Steps or Strategies for ITTA In the manuscript, we use one TTT step for ITTA before during the testing step. In this section, we conduct experi- ments to evaluate the performances of ITTA with different TTT steps. Experiments are conducted on the PACS bench- mark [37] with the leave-one-out strategy, and each target domain is examined with 60 sets of random seeds and hyper- parameter settings. Results are listed in Table 8. We observe that the average accuracies of using more TTT steps are not improved greatly while the computational times are propor- tional to the TTT steps. To this end, we use one TTT step for ITTA as a compromise between accuracy and efficiency. We use the online setting from TTT [60] for all arts, which assumes test samples arrive sequentially and updates the adaptive blocks based on the states optimized from a previous sample. In this section, we also test ITTA in an episodic manner (i.e. Epi) [12]. Results in Table 8 suggest that while the episodic updating strategy performs slightly worse than the current scheme, and it still outperforms the baseline. 12. Different Network Structures for the Learnable Consistency Loss and Adaptive Parameters In our implementation, we use 10 layers of learnable pa- rameters for fw, and we use 5 layers of learnable parameters for fΘ after each block. In this section, we evaluate our ITTA with different network structures for these two mod- ules. Specifically, we compare the original implementation with the variants that use 1, 5, and 15 layers for fw and 1, 10, and 15 layers for fΘ to evaluate the performances of dif- ferent structures. Similarly, we conduct experiments on the PACS benchmark [37] with the leave-one-out strategy, and each target domain is examined with 60 sets of random seeds and hyper-parameter settings. Evaluation results are listed in Table 9. We observe that their differences in the average accuracy are rather subtle on account of the variances.

We use images with varying class labels (i.e. giraffe, elephant, house, and horse from top to bottom) from the four target domains of PACS [37] as inputs (i.e. art, cartoon, photo, and sketch domains from top to bottom). “Entropy” and “Rotation” here denote the entropy minimization and rotation estimation tasks in [63] and [60]. Ours w/o fw is the learnable consistency loss in Eq. (1) in the manuscript (i.e. ∥fw(z − z′)∥) when fw is disabled. The proposed learnable consistency loss can align well with the main classification task. Table 6. Sensitivity analysis of ITTA regarding different values ofα in the unseen domain from PACS [37].

Since the adaptive blocks fΘ are attached after each layer of the network, one may wonder how the varying locations of the adaptive blocks affect the performance of ITTA. To answer this question, we further conduct experiments by adding the adaptive blocks after different layers of the orig- inal network. Denoting as Loc = lan given the n layers in the original network, we note that the model performs less effectively when the adaptive block is placed after the 1st layer of the network, and using all four adaptive blocks (i.e. ours) is more effective than other alternatives. 13.

Examples include MetaReg [2] and Feature-Critic [45] which both suggest using meta-learning to produce more general models. The main difference between these arts and ITTA is that parameters in the auxiliary loss from [2,45] are gradually refined by episode training, and they are updated via a gradient alignment step in ITTA (see Sec. 3.1 in the manuscript), which is much simpler. In this sec- tion, we compare ITTA with these two arts in the PACS dataset [37] using the same settings aforementioned. Be- cause MetaReg [2] does not release codes, we thus directly cite the data from their paper in the comparison. Different from others, the results in [2] are averaged by 5 trials accord- ing to their paper, which is much less than our experimental settings. Meanwhile, we also compare with TTT++ [46] which suggests storing the momentum of the features from the source domain and enforcing the similarity between mo- mentums of features from the source and target domains. We use the same setting in Section 5.1 from the manuscript to evaluate TTT++. Results are listed in Table 10. We observe that our method consistently outperforms that from [2,45,46] for both the cases with and without TTT, indicating that the proposed learnable consistency loss and updating method is not only simpler but also more effective than the losses in [2, 45]. 14. Detailed Results in the DomainBed Bench- mark [27] this section presents the average accuracy in each domain from different datasets. As shown in Table 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15, these results are detailed illustrations of the results in Table 2 in our manuscript. For all the experiments, we use the “training-domain validate set” as the model selection method. A total of 22 methods are examined for 60 trials in each unseen domain, and all methods are trained with the leave-one-out strategy using the ResNet18 [30] backbones.Table 9.

{
    "main_contributions": "The paper addresses the distribution shift problem in Domain Generalization (DG) by proposing an Improved Test-Time Adaptation (ITTA) method. The main contributions are: 1) Introducing a learnable consistency loss for the test-time training (TTT) task, which features learnable parameters that can be adjusted to align better with the main prediction task by enforcing shared optimization directions. 2) Proposing the inclusion of additional adaptive parameters within the trained model, with the strategy of updating only these new parameters during the test phase, leaving the original model parameters unchanged. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ITTA achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on various DG benchmarks for both multi-source and single-source DG tasks.",
    "methodology": "ITTA improves Test-Time Training (TTT) through two main strategies. First, a learnable consistency loss (Lwcont) is introduced for the TTT auxiliary task. This loss is defined as the L2 norm of the output of a weight subnetwork (fw) applied to the difference between original and augmented feature representations (z - z'). The fw subnetwork, composed of stacked ReLU(a * h + b) layers, allows for flexible consistency measurement. During training, the feature extractor and classifier are optimized using a combined main loss and learnable consistency loss (Lmain + αLwcont). The fw subnetwork is updated by minimizing the difference between the normalized gradients of Lmain and Lwcont with respect to the feature extractor parameters, ensuring alignment. Second, additional adaptive parameter blocks (fΘ) are introduced after each block of the pretrained feature extractor during the test-time adaptation phase. Only these fΘ parameters are updated using the learned consistency loss from the target domain data, following an online adaptation setting. The augmentation strategy used is an existing method that modifies intermediate activations to create augmented feature representations.",
    "experimental_setup": "ITTA was evaluated on five benchmark datasets: PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, TerraInc, and DomainNet, covering diverse image categories and domain shifts. The backbone model for all experiments was an ImageNet-pretrained ResNet18 with 4 blocks as the feature extractor. The proposed adaptive parameters (fΘ) consisted of 4 blocks, each with 5 learnable layers, while the weight subnetwork (fw) used 10 learnable layers. The classifier was an MLP layer. Hyperparameters, including random seeds, learning rates, batch size, and augmentation skills, were dynamically set according to the rigorous DomainBed benchmark protocol. Evaluations included multi-source domain generalization (using a leave-one-out strategy) and single-source domain generalization (trained on one domain, tested on three others on PACS). Each setting involved 60 trials, with model selection based on the 'training-domain validate set' method, and final performance reported as average accuracy. Comparisons were made against 22 existing DG methods and several TTT-based approaches (TTT, MT3, TENT, MetaReg, Feature-Critic, TTT++).",
    "limitations": "The proposed ITTA method incurs increased computational costs. While updating the model without the weight subnetwork (fw disabled) requires 1 forward and 1 backward pass, enabling fw for the learnable consistency loss and its alignment objective necessitates computing second-order derivatives, which demands 1 additional forward and 3 additional backward passes. This significantly increases the burden on the system during training. During testing, the adaptation process involves extra forward and backward steps, leading to increased FLOPS and inference time compared to the baseline model.",
    "future_research_directions": "Future efforts will focus on simplifying the overall optimization process of ITTA and reducing its computational cost to alleviate the extra burden on the system caused by the learnable consistency loss and its gradient alignment step."
