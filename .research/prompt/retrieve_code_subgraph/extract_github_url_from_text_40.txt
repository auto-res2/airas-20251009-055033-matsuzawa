# Paper Outline
TNT approximates the natural gradient by using a block-diagonal Fisher matrix, with each block corresponding to the covariance of a tensor variable. It assumes that the sampling-based gradient for each tensor variable (Wl) follows a zero-mean Tensor-Normal (TN) distribution, resulting in a Kronecker-factored Fisher matrix (FW = U1 iguplus ... iguplus Uk). The method identifies unique covariance parameters (	ilda{U}i) by enforcing that the average eigenvalues of the covariance matrices for each tensor dimension are equal. The update direction is calculated by applying the inverse of the Kronecker-factored Fisher matrix to the gradient. For practical implementation, moving average estimates of relevant statistics are used, and inverse computations are amortized over multiple iterations.
