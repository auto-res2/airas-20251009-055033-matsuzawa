# Paper Outline
MOCA extends Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection (BOCPD) to conditional density estimation, using a base meta-learning algorithm as the underlying predictive model (UPM). It recursively maintains and updates a belief distribution over run lengths (time since the last changepoint) using Bayesian filtering rules. Upon observing new data (xt, yt), MOCA updates the belief based on the input likelihood pθ(xt|ηt−1[rt]) and the conditional predictive likelihood pθ(yt|xt,ηt−1[rt]). The run length belief is then propagated forward in time, assuming a fixed hazard rate for task switches. The entire process is differentiable, allowing backpropagation to optimize the parameters of the base meta-learning algorithm. MOCA was instantiated and evaluated with an LSTM-based meta-learner, ALPaCA (a Bayesian meta-learning approach for regression), and PCOC (Probabilistic Clustering for Online Classification), a novel Bayesian meta-learning algorithm for classification based on Gaussian discriminant analysis in a learned feature space.
