# Paper Outline
AETTA's methodology is grounded in comparing a model's prediction with predictions from its dropout inferences, termed Prediction Disagreement with Dropouts (PDD). It assumes 'dropout independence' (dropout inferences simulate i.i.d. models) and 'confidence-prediction calibration' to theoretically approximate test error with PDD. To address adaptation failures, which often lead to over-confident incorrect predictions and violate standard calibration, AETTA proposes 'robust confidence-prediction calibration'. This is achieved by introducing a weighting constant 'b' that dynamically scales predicted probabilities. The constant 'b' is determined by the skewness of predicted outputs, specifically using the entropy of batch-aggregated softmax values from dropout inferences (Eavg), modeled as b = (Eavg / Emax)^(-α). The final accuracy estimation (Err) is approximated as ErrDT(h) ≈ b PDDDT(h), with C omitted due to lack of information. The process involves performing N dropout inferences, calculating PDD and Eavg, and then applying the scaling factor 'b' to estimate the error. Exponential moving average is applied for stable error estimation.
